#Lab Assignment 3
Write the MIPS assembly program to compute the Nth term of fibonacci series (assume first term as 0 and second term as 1) using both â€“ iterative and recursive approach. For both the approaches, you must also find out what is the maximum stack size as a function of the input value N? Add instructions to find the maximum size to which the stack grows. You are encouraged to formulate this and show using plots how maximum stack size varies for these two approaches, given the same input value.

For the given input N, your program should output the Nth term of Fibonacci series computed iteratively and the one computed recursively (ofcourse both would be same only). You must also mention the maximum stack size in both cases.

If input N provided is not a positive integer, your console shall mention an error message and shall ask for the input again

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

###Sample Run as shown below
Enter N = 8<br>

Nth term computed iteratively = 13<br>
Maximum Stack size = 4<br>
Nth term computed recursively = 13<br>
Maximum Stack size = 32<br>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note:<br>
Maximum stack size mentioned above are just some random values (it may not be the correct and will depend upon your implementation too. It is mentioned above just for conveying you the output format)
